Hello :) this one here is a quick and easy Pong game made in Python, inspired by the 80's game of same name. This one here was made using Turtle(for the main programming) and for the final sound effects, I used PyGame. 
I followed this tutorial by FreeCodeCamp.org (these guys are amazing, go give them some praise!) (A) and made my own tuning of the code, by adding some functions to avoid repetition and things like that.
You might notice that there are some bugs when it comes to the ball hitting the wall and the paddle at the same time, but it is an easy fix by just changing the values of the limits on the condition by the very end of the code.
When it comes to the bouncing ball, I've cut the original sound to make it way shorter, so it would fit properly. And I think that's it!
IMPORTANT: If you would like to run this code on your computer, don't forget to add the sound file to the same folder of your python script. If, however, you would like to put your own sound to it, you must change
the name of the file in the play_sound() function in the beginning.
